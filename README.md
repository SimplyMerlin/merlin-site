<h1 align="center"><code>Merlin Site üåç</code></h1>

<p align="center">
 My own personal site that I worked VERY hard on!
 <br>
 <a href="https://simplymerlin.com/">https://simplymerlin.com/</a>
</p>

## Why?
I needed a place I can show people to trick them into thinking I'm good at editing. This site suffices. 

There is also some [stuff I wrote](https://simplymerlin.com/snippets). Not really advertised anywhere, but it's stuff I care about and you might also care about!

## Stack
- Astro
- Tailwind
- Obsidian (for markdown editing and writing)
